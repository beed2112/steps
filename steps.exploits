For example, we can search for all available remote exploits that target the SMB service on the 
Windows operating system with the following syntax: 

kali@kali:~$ searchsploit remote smb microsoft windows 

copy
searchsploit -m windows/remote/48537.py 

look at Examine.. 

searchsploit -x windows/remote/48537.py


 (p378)
We can use mingw-w64 to compile the code into a Windows Portable Executable (PE)578 file. The 
first step is to determine if the exploit code compiles without errors. We can do this by invoking 
the cross-compiler, passing the C source file as the first argument and the output PE file name as 
the second argument, prepended by the -o parameter.


kali@kali:~$ i686-w64-mingw32-gcc 42341.c -o syncbreeze_exploit.exe  -lws2_32
